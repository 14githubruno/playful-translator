## A tribute to pseudo-languages

This translator is the first actual project I worked on, built using HTML, pure CSS and vanilla JS. The main idea comes from my discovery of Pig Latin, due to a [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) exercise.

After this funny "alphabetical" encounter and some basic research, I clearly found out (as expected) that Pig Latin has many siblings and relatives scattered around the world, thus the project took shape.

Long story short, the aim of this little work was to gather in one place 5 different pseudo-languages, that is allowing the user 5 different translations: from Italian into `Farfallino`, from French into `Javanais`, from Spanish into `Jeringonza`, from German into `LÃ¶ffelsprache` and from English into `Pig Latin`.

The translator has both dark and light mode enabled (dark mode is the default one) and provides for each pseudo-language a dedicated section containing the rules of translation.
